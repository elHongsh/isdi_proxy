## What proxy do?

VaultPoint proxy is a centralized system that mediate client's authentication/authorization request to right holders by firing remote push notification.  
To send a notification, proxy requires FCM secret key which is issued by FCM(what we call it `SERVER_KEY`).
All data except client's request are encrypted by client's public-key and these keys are stored in Ethereum blockchain.
